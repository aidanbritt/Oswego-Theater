	Located in Oswego, NY the Oswego 7 Cinemas designed 1940 with an Art Deco style.
	It was built with red, white and dark red bricks laid out in a horizontal and perpendicular belt. 
	The theater was designed by John Eberson and built by M. Shapiro and sons of New York City.
	Originally named the Hippodrome theater that opened in 1910, now called the Oswego 7 Cinemas. 
	It gets its name due to being split up into 7 screens, like any other theater it was split into three sections,
	center, left, and right. They now use their balconies to house the projectors in order to project the movies onto 
	their big screens.The theater used to only have one big screen with a large seating area for the viewers.
	This theater is also known for its amazing artwork on the ceilings that is still there to this date. 
	They have since added reclining chairs to the theaters for people to watch their movie comfortably.
