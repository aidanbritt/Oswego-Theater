			The Oswego 7 Cinemas operates today as a 7 screen cinema with comfortable, red, automatically reclining seats that give it's antique decor a modern upgrade. This building was not always a Cinema. The Oswego 7 Cinemas was originally a theater for live shows such as musicals, opera, and plays. You can even see the stage in the main theater. We would like to show the glory of this old theater in an interactive way. Check out our Artivive for an interactive tour of the historic Oswego 7 Cinemas!!
